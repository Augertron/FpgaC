This example includes both sequential and pipelined implementations.
It also provides and example of setting up test benches for FpgaC
applications.

The round key code is inline, and for best performance needs to either
be moved out of line, or rearranged in the pipeline.

The test bench produces the following outputs for the FIPS example:

	Round 1 data after Mix Columns
	    04 e0 48 28
	    66 cb f8 06
	    81 19 d3 26
	    e5 9a 7a 4c  Round 1 data is correct

	Round 2 data after Mix Columns
	    58 1b db 1b
	    4d 4b e7 6b
	    ca 5a ca b0
	    f1 ac a8 e5  Round 2 data is correct

	Round 11 final output data
	    39 02 dc 19
	    25 dc 11 6a
	    84 09 85 0b
	    1d fb 97 32  Round 11 final output data is correct
