PCI Target Mode demo code -- work in progress -- need Fpgac fixes

This project is waiting on a bug fix for io variables in structures.
It currently doesn't compile, but will in another day or so.

This is an example of interfacing to a synchronous bus with FpgaC.

The fpgac_process pci is designed to run directly off the PCI bus
clock, and be a standards conformant PCI 2.2 target mode interface.

The design is based on a one hot state machine using the variables
target_sm and next_target_sm. There is one if statement per state,
plus an async reset state. The fpgac_process pci is invoked for
each PCI clock, processing the current state, and then updating
next_target_sm state to target_sm. 

The use of the one hot allows the if statements for each state to
be dependent on a single bit AND operation for the conditional,
and avoids doing a parallel subtract comparison if this was a
normal char/int C variable. There is also an excess of masking to
trim bits (particularly the sign bits), and shifts which are not
done at runtime, but by the compiler, thus they are "free" since
they do not create additional logic.
