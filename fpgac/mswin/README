This directory is an initial collection of files useful for compiling FpgaC
on Microsoft Windows platforms with several common development systems.

We are actively looking for developers, maintainers, packagers and testers
for MS Windows platforms.

	WinSetup.html     Read this First!

Makefiles and scripts for common platforms:

	makefile.bcc
	makefile.mingw
	makefile.msvc
	setpath.bat
	fpgac_skel.vbs
	fpgac.wskel

Additional development files you may need for your platform to compile FpgaC:

	basename.c
	libgen.h
	snprintf.c
	snprintf.h
	unistd.h

Help getting native binary releases for these platforms would be greatly
appreciated.

Also getting scripting help for directly interfacing FpgaC to various FPGA/PLD
vendors tools would be greatly appreciated as well.
