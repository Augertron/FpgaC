</div>
FpgaC (or fpgac) is compiler for a subset of the
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/">C programming language</a>,
which produces
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_circuit">digital circuits</a>
that will execute the compiled programs. The circuits may use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA">FPGA</a>s or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPLD">CPLD</a>s as the target processor for
<a href="Reconfigurable_computing">reconfigurable computing</a>, or even
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC</a>s
for dedicated applications. FpgaCs goal is to be an efficient
High Level Language (HLL) for reconfigurable computing, rather than a
Hardware Description Language (HDL) for building efficient custom
hardware circuits.
<h3>The FpgaC Project Team</h3>
The beta-3 release includes project work by John Bass. See the
top level README file for other contributions and project history.
<p>
The beta-2 release includes project work since the initial beta release
by Isaac Pentinmaki, Rahul Menon, and John Bass. Supporting
work setting up CVS/SVN done by Mark Phillips.
<p>
The core developers for this project are not employer supported, and
most of us are self employed consultants that take time from our
families and other paying work to support this project. If you

<h3>Devices are supported</h3>
FpgaC has been used to target several families of FPGAs:
<p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Xilinx XC4000 and Spartan series (Using older ISE versions and ISE Classic)<br>
Xilinx Virtex, Virtex-E, Virtex-II and Virtex-Pro Series (Using Edif conversions)<br>
Altera FLEX 8K, 10K, and Stratix VQM series
</div>
<p>
and certainly others by users we do not know about. Let us know about your use.
<p>
The <a href="http://www.elook.org/computing/xilinx-netlist-format.htm">XNF</a>
output targeting Xilinx XC4000, Spartan and several Altera parts may be used
directly. The Xilinx XNF formats may be used directly with older ISE releases,
or with the free ISE Classic in support of XC4K and Spartan FPGAs. Newer
Xilinx ISE releases no longer support XNF inputs, and will require the xnf
output to be converted to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDIF">EDIF</a>
format using older Xilinx ISE tools, or third party tools. FpgaC is very likely
to support native EDIF net list outputs soon in a future release.
<p>
The VHDL net list output (needs a maintainer/developer) is partially
supported in this release, and can also be feed into a variety of
vendor tool chains, possibly with editing.
<p>
The Altera net list output (needs a maintainer/developer) is partially
supported in this release.
<p>
The FpgaC team is eager to support other vendors product lines as well.
Donations of demonstration boards (and software with licenses if needed)
are greatly appreciated to expand our ability to test other products.
<p>
<h3>Example FpgaC program</h3>
Here is a simple FpgaC program that makes the 8
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED">LED</a>s on the
<a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/ese/rca/pchardware/demoboard/demoboard.html">Xilinx 4000 demo board</a>
count up:
<pre>
    struct ports {
        volatile unsigned char lights;  // PINS=(60,59,58,57,66,65,62,61)
    } io;

    main() {
        char count;
        count = 0;
        while(1) {
            count = count + 1;
            io.lights = ~count;
        }
    }
</pre>
The <dfn>volatile</dfn> declaration tells the compiler the <var>lights</var>
variable is really a set of 8 output pins on the chip.  The
executing program then goes into an infinite loop, incrementing
the count. The LEDs on the demo board are wired so that a 0 output
turns them on, and a 1 output turns them off. To invert this,
we use C's '~' complement operator.
<h3>Running FpgaC</h3>
To compile this sample program, call it counter.c, and run:
<pre>
    $ fpgac counter.c
</pre>
The compiler will produce a counter.xnf file, then pass it through your
FPGA vendors tool chain to produce a bit stream file suitable for
programming your FPGA, CPLD, or even as input to your ASIC design
stream.  [You may need to edit scripts for this to work at your site.]
All other intermediate files will be removed. If you want to save
them, use the -v flag.
<p>
If you just want to see the net list output, and not run the vendor
tool chain, use the -S flag. The optional -ppartname flag can be used
to tell FpgaC what part you are targeting The compiler will put that
information into the net list file that it generates, for the use of
other tools. The compiler also supports these normal C compiler flags:
-U, and -D.
<p>
If you didn't get any net list out, the most common error is not
defining output pins. FpgaC does dead code removal, by removing
all code that doesn't affect an output pin.
<h3>Progress Implementing Standard ANSI-C 1998</h3>
These ANSI C operators and keywords are implemented by the FpgaC compiler:
<pre>
    +  += - -= * *= / /=
    %  %= &amp; &amp;= | |= ^ ^=
    ~  !  ++ -- &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=
    ==  !=  &lt; &lt;= &gt;  &gt;= &amp;&amp;   ||<br>
    () = , {} . [] ?      :

    if, then, else, do, while, for, break, return

    _Bool, char, int, short, long, long long
    float, double, long double
    signed, unsigned, register, volatile
    enum, struct, "strings"
    void, auto, extern, static
</pre>
These C operators and keywords are not implemented by the FpgaC compiler:
<pre>
    unary &amp; unary *  -&gt;
    switch, case, default, continue, goto
    sizeof, union, typedef, (casts)
</pre>
In other words, FpgaC has 1, 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit integer variables, plus
floating variables of lengths 32, 64, and 128, constants, enum,
expressions and assignment statements for these. It has <dfn>if</dfn> statements,
<dfn>for</dfn> loops, <dfn>while</dfn> loops, <dfn>do{} while()</dfn> loops,
and <dfn>function</dfn> calls.
Structure allocations and bit fields are implemented.
You can also use any of the <dfn>cpp</dfn> # directives and macros.
<p>
It does not currently have <dfn>switch</dfn>, <dfn>case</dfn>, <dfn>default</dfn>,
<dfn>continue</dfn>, pointers, <dfn>union</dfn>, structure assignments,
or structure arrays.  You can not use recursion.  Variable initialization is
partially supported, but initialized structures are not currently supported.
Constant expressions (including enum variable references) are
evaluated at compile time to avoid multiply, divide, and remainder
operations at runtime where possible. Small "strings" are supported
both as initializers of character arrays, and as indexed literals in
expressions:
<pre>
     for(i=0; out = "Hello World!"[i]; i++);
</pre>
where strings and indexed literals are limited to the size of a LUT
based rom for a given target architecture.
<p>
Small one dimensional arrays which are implemented as LUT RAMs that
may be single or dual ported depending on the number of references
in a clock cycle. Depending on the target technology, sizes may be
limited to 16, 32 or 64. Multiple references to the same array will
create multiple dualport LUT RAMs with replicated write functions.
Larger arrays may be allocated from block rams, external memories,
or other vendor specific solutions, and will require the user to
provide macros to interface to them or changes to the net list output
function.
<p>
Multiply, Divide, Mod/Remainder are implemented as intrinsic functions:
<p>
<pre>
    A * B calls fpgac_multiply(A, B)
    A / B calls fpgac_divide(A, B)
    A % B calls fpgac_remainder(A, B)
</pre>
and may be implemented by users in the best way for their application
and target hardware platform. See the intrinics directory with the
examples.
<p>
Floating point is currently in the process of being implemented as
intrinsic functions, with a partial implementation in place. If you are
interested in using floating point with FpgaC contact the project team.
<p>
Most of the simple omitted stuff will get
added to FpgaC as developers are available to the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fpgac">Sourceforge FpgaC
project</a>. Current plans are to implement remaining keywords
and operators, except for pointers and goto in the near term.
<p>
All integer variables are created as their specified width, plus a sign
bit. For now, that includes unsigned variables too. Shortly, signed
integers will be one bit less as the width
specification will include the sign bit, and unsigned will not include
a sign bit. A char currently is 8 bits plus a sign bit, short
is 16 bits plus a sign bit, long is 32 bits plus a sign bit,
and long long is 64 bits plus a sign bit.
<h3>Extensions to C</h3>
 #pragma intbits nnn
<p>
The intbits pragma sets the number of bits stored in each integer.
Any integer variables declared after the intbits directive will be
allocated as nnn bits.  The default number of bits in an integer is 16.
<p>
The FpgaC compiler accepts constants in decimal, octal, and hex as found
in most C compilers. It also accepts binary in the 0b0010 form found in
the Intel C/C++ compiler (and others) and other HDL's.
<br>
<h3>Input, Output and Tri-State Bus Port Extensions</h3>
A variable declared as volatile will be associated with external device pins.
Variables assigned (written to) will have an output buffer instantiated.
Variables referenced (read from) will have an input buffer instantiated.
Variables which are both assigned and referenced, will be instantiated as
a tri-state IO buffer, which is enabled on write, and disabled on read. Only
a single assignment per variable will be scheduled in a clock period, with
additional assignments to the same variable resulting in one clock period
delays. A write to a tri-state buffer, followed by a read, will assert that
output until the next clock, then remove the tri-state enable and capture
the read reference at the next clock.
<p>
<h3>Process Function Extension</h3>
An experimental feature called process functions was introduced in the
Beta-2 Release.
Process functions are declared with type fpgac_process:
<p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">fpgac_process myprocess()
</div>
<p>
and are automatically started at load time like main. Process functions are
currently implemented to also automatically loop, so they can not
end. This makes them very useful for building FSMs which
interface to external I/O pins.
<p>
For test benching this feature on a traditional processor, simply
typedef fpgac_process to void, and call from the test bench with a loop
that includes simulation of the I/O pin states. This allows test
bench controllers to be built without threads, as they are in control
of the process at each call.<br>
<h3>Timing and Clock Ticks</h3>
FpgaC generates a simple synchronous design. It has one clock, and all
flip flops in a clock domain change on the rising edge of that clock.
<p>
FpgaC will attempt to stuff as much of a group of statements as it can
into the current clock period. Multiple assignment statements and even if
statements will all get packed into the current clock period. It will
only stop doing this and wait for the next clock tick at any of these
points in the program:
<p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
the top of a while() or for() loop
<p>
a function call
<p>
multiple assignments to the same array.
</div>
<p>
Although FpgaC attempts to pack as many statements as
possible into the same clock tick, it still works like C.
Statements are executed in the effective order that you write them in.
Variable assignments take affect immediately, although they may not
show up on an output pin until the following clock cycle. This code:
<p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 temp = a;<br>
 a = b; <br>
 b = temp;
</div>
<p>
will exchange the values of a and b, just as it does in C. The
exchange will take place in the current clock cycle, and no flipflop
or other circuitry will be generated for temp.
<p>
Multiple assignments to the same array cause additional clocks so that
the address lines can be changed and the data clocked for each array
assignment.
<br>
<h3>Building Hardware Pipelines</h3>
C to net list compilers have to preserve the sequential operation of C,
and frequently try to capitalize on it by building combinatorials
foreach C code block. That however, may create deep combinatorials,
which slow the clock rate. For instance, the following C code block will form
a long combinatorial that ripples from a to d:
<p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 b += a;<br>
 c += b;<br>
 d += c;
</div>
<p>
Reversing the blocks however, uses the sequential semantics to our
benefit by creating a pipeline where each statement is a shorter
combinatorial chain (faster clock rate):
<p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 d += c;<br>
 c += b;<br>
 b += a;
</div>
<p>
The results for this example will clock out of d, after a two clock
latency with undefined data. Likewise at the end of the data stream,
two additional clocks will be required for the last to data points.
<p>
It takes a little more work to initialize and manage pipelines, but for
large algorithm C code blocks, they can provide significant performance
gains. Since the execution of these pipelines have the same results on
traditional sequential processors, the pipelined code is easily
debugged before moving it to FpgaC for FPGA execution.
<p>
If using a single clock in a design, then the whole program can not run
any faster than the slowest combinatorial statement block. To avoid
this currently require breaking the program into separate files/treads,
and assigning clocks optimized for each threads performance. Many
current FPGAs have more flexible clocking available, and future changes
to FpgaC may include clock assignment on a function by function basis
and include the synchronizers necessary to manage communications across
multiple clock domains.
<p>
In addition it is planned (see feature requests) to implement fork,
exec, and POSIX threads and allow multiple files to share the same
thread, thus allowing libraries with precompiled netlists (cores) to be
introduced into FpgaC. The current practice of creating one thread for
each file will then be depreciated.
<br>
<h3>Clock Source</h3>
There can only be one
clock source for a C file. The default XNF file clock input is
from an external
pin named CLKin:
<p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 SYM, CLK-AA, BUFGP<br>
 PIN, I, I, CLKin<br>
 PIN, O, O, CLK<br>
 END<br>
 EXT, CLKin, I<br>
 SYM, STARTUP, STARTUP<br>
 PIN, CLK, I, CLK<br>
 END
</div>
<p>
If you want to use a name other than CLK for the clock source without
creating the clock buffer, use the
-cYOURCLOCKNAME option. A simple -c option will leave the clock
name as CLK, and will generate the XC4000's default 15 Hz clock
circuitry.
<p>
You may use the pragma fpgac_clock(clockname) to use a different clock
name and buffer for multiple clock domain designs using multiple files.
<p>
Planned is work toward clock
"bining" to fit statement blocks to the fastest clock that block can
use. See feature requests for more info.
<br>
<h3>Multiple Threads of Control</h3>
A simple FpgaC program has one thread of control, which starts the main
thread at the beginning of the main() routine and executes from there.
Many circuits have to do several tasks simultaneously, for instance:
handling the bus protocol for an input and output bus, talking to
several external devices, or doing real-time computation and control.
Additional threads are created with fpgac_process functions.
<p>
Currently, only a single process may write a global variable, and all
functions for that process must reside in the same source file. A global
variable my be referenced (read by) any process which shares the same
clock.
<p>
Currently, only a single process may call a function, and all the callers
must be in the same source file.
<p>
These two restrictions are expected to be removed in a later release
once we have a 'linker' which can construct the required muxes and
semaphores.
<p>
If you need multiple instances of the same file, each instance can be
compiled with -T to prefix the function names for each instance.
<br>
<h3>Modifying Input and Output Port Semantics</h3>
An input or output port has a set of attributes. These attributes
should be externally configured using vendor constraint files and
tools.
<p>
In the future, FpgaC will probably also support synthesis hints in
comments similar to other HDL's.
<br>
<h3>Compiler Options and Output Formats</h3>
$ fpgac -h<br>
usage: fpgac [options] file.c
[file2.xnf ...]<br>
options:<br>
-D/-U/-I cpp arguments<br>
-Fformatstring format string used for external bus names<br>
-O optimize circuit for speed and size<br>
-S produce net list file, but don't run ppr<br>
-Tn unique name prefix (multi-threaded circuits only)<br>
-a don't run cpp<br>
-c don't generate 15 Hz clock from internal OSC<br>
-dn set debug level<br>
-fno-carry-select use ripple carry adders and counters (smaller/slower)<br>
-fcarry-select use carry select adders and counters (default)<br>
-m don't minimize net list with prune (debugging tool)<br>
-p part specify FPGA part name<br>
-s give estimate of circuit size and depth<br>
-target flex8000 generate XNF AND/OR/INV format for Altera FLEX 8K<br>
-target cnf-eqns generate CNF EQN format<br>
-target cnf-gates generate CNF AND/OR/INV format<br>
-target cnf-roms generate CNF ROM format<br>
-target stratix_vqm generate Altera Stratix VQM format<br>
-target vhd generate VHDL format<br>
-target xnf-eqns generate XNF EQN format (default)<br>
-target xnf-gates generate XNF AND/OR/INV format<br>
-target xnf-roms generate XNF ROM format<br>
-v don't remove junk ppr output files<br><br>
The -target flag specifies the output net list format.
<p>
The default -target xnf-gates will generate a simple XNF (Xilinx Netlist Format)
file that uses AND, OR and INV gates. This format can be read by
several FPGA synthesis and optimization CAD tools. The compiler
performs a technology mapping step as it is compiling a program, and
converts the circuit to a network of 4 input lookup tables and
flipflop.
<p>
The -target xnf-roms flag
will generate a more compact
output format with each lookup table expressed as a 16x1 bit ROM.
<p>
The -target xnf-eqns flag
will gen-erate a more readable compact format
with each lookup table expressed as a Boolean equation.<br>
<br>
The -target
flex8000 flag will generate an XNF file using AND, OR and INV
gates
that is suitable for the Altera Flex8000 parts, and can be read by the
Altera MaxPlus software.<br>
<br>
The CNF (Compact Netlist Format) outputs are FpgaC specific for
debugging and as an intermediate format for conversion to other net
list
formats. CNF has a C like syntax with assignment statements
representing LUTs, FFs, and IO port declarations with optional pin
specification. There are three operators, "*" for AND, "+" for OR, and
"~" for negation in the boolean expressions. Plus "^" respresents a
clocked operator for FFs and memory elements which are written.
The syntax for a LUT is simply the output name, followed by "=",
followed by a boolean expression. of the inputs:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 c = (b*a); // c gets a AND b<br>
</div>
<br>
FF statements are represented by specifing either:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 c^CLK = a; // c gets a after clocked by CLK<br>
</div>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 c^(CLK*CE) = a; // c gets a after clocked by CLK, if enabled by CE<br>
</div>
<br>
Output using the -m flag is not useful for hardware implementation, as
it outputs net list components that were used as internally and would
normally be discarded. This is mostly useful for FpgaC internals
developers debugging the compiler.<br>
<br>
<h3>Xilinx ISE Support</h3>
The
current Xilinx net list output is still XNF based and requires using
xnf2edf (possibly with some editing)
to use FpgaC with current versions of Xilinx ISE and modern
FPGAs. The backend of your fpgac script may look something like this
(ISE 4.2i/6.1i mixed example, other releases vary):<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">case
$optimize in<br>
false) mapargs="-k 4";
parargs="-ol std"<br>

;;<br>
<br>
force) mapargs="-k 6";
parargs="-ol high"<br>

;;<br>
esac<br
>
<br>
xnf2edf.exe $file.xnf<br
>
ngdbuild -intstyle ise -dd `pwd`
-uc $file.ucf $file.edf $file.ngd<br
>
map -intstyle ise -cm area -pr b
$mapargs -c 100 -tx off -o $file.ncd $file.ngd $file.pcf<br
>
par -w -intstyle ise $parargs -t
1 $file.ncd $file.ncd $file.pcf<br
>
trce -intstyle ise -e 3 -l 3 -xml
$file $file.ncd -o $file.twr $file.pcf<br
>
bitgen -intstyle ise -f $file.ut
$file.ncd<br>
</div>
<br>
where xnf2edf.exe is from an ISE
4.x release (run under wine), and the other tools are from an ISE 6.x
release using Linux as the host operating system. ngdbuild, map, par,
trce, and bitgen are all /usr/local/bin scripts to setup the Xilinx ISE
environment (using map as the example):
<pre>
        LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1;export
        LD_ASSUME_KERNEL
        PATH=/usr/local/xilinx/bin/lin:$PATH
        export PATH
        . /usr/local/xilinx/settings.sh
        /usr/local/xilinx/bin/lin/map $*
</pre>
with a symlink for xnf2edf:
<pre>
        xnf2edf -&gt; /WinMe/XilinxFdn4/active/exe/xnf2edf.exe
</pre>
The <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/ise/logic_design_prod/classics.htm">Xilinx
ISE Classics release</a> which supports the Spartan and XC4000 series
FPGAs is available for free download off the Xilinx site, and works
directly with the current FpgaC. This allows use of older
inexpensive XC4K and Spartan student project boards, including the
popular <a href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Data/Products/XLA/XLA-brochure.pdf">Digilent XLA series XCS10 Spartan boards</a>,
for the hobbyist on a budget or
someone just wanting to learn about FPGAs and have a useful breadboard
environment to play with FPGA interfacing. The download cable for the
older Digilent boards isn't recognized by newer ISE releases. One
workaround is to grab the Xilinx download utility off an older ISE
release, such as ISE 1.5 student edition.
<h3>Altera Support</h3>
The current Altera support was adopted from the TMCC work for the <a
 href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/EECG/RESEARCH/FPGA.html">Transmogrifier</a>
projects, and has not been updated for arrays, but should otherwise
work (at least for older versions of the Altera tool chain).
<p>
If you are actively developing with Altera product, please consider
joining the FpgaC development team to support the newer Altera devices
and software. There isn't anyone on the FpgaC
actively supporting Altera development (mostly people using
Xilinx). If someone could provide/donate one, or more, Altera
development board(s) and software with license, that would change quickly.
<h3>Other Fpga Vendor Support</h3>
If you are actively developing with FPGA product, please consider
joining the FpgaC development team to support that vendors devices
and software. If someone could provide/donate one, or more, development
board(s) and software with license, that would change support for those
product lines quickly.
<p>
We would like to have broad support across multiple vendors lines for
FpgaC.
<h3>Understanding how FpgaC generates a circuit for execution</h3>
Hardware designers, and advanced programmers doing reconfigurable
computing will need to have a basic understanding of how FpgaC
translates programs for execution on FPGAs. Knowledge of basic
boolean algebra and digital circuit design theory is useful, but not
specifically required in order to use FpgaC. It is helpful for
debugging complex problems, or to write very efficient FpgaC code which
maximizes performance on the target computing platform.
<p>
The output circuit for each thread is a single clocked synchronous circuit,
with a "one hot" state encoding scheme. The procedural flow of the program is
broken into clocked blocks enabled by their respective "one hot" state
variable. This creates sequential execution in a natively parallel
hardware execution environment. For example, the simple program:
<pre>
	volatile _Bool a;
	volatile _Bool b;
	volatile _Bool output;

	_Bool t;

	main() {
	    while(1) {
		output = t;
		t = (a&amp;b);
	    }
	}
</pre>
takes the a input port and the b input port, logically ANDs the two
values togather, and outputs the result one clock later on the c output
port. The parallel digital logic circuit produced (in CNF format)
is this collection of 5 LUT/FFs, and 3 I/O ports:
<pre>
	$ fpgac -target cnf simple.c; cat simple.cnf
	simple/Running^CLK = VCC;
	a^CLK = port(a);
	b^CLK = port(b);
	t^(CLK*simple/main/S0/T0/looptop) = (b*a);
	port(output)^(CLK*simple/main/S0/T0/looptop) = t;
	simple/main/S0/T0/looptop^CLK = (~simple/Running)+(simple/main/S0/T0/looptop);
</pre>
While this net list looks something like C, it is not sequential. All
of the cnf statements are processed concurrently.
<p>
All FFs are zero initially. After the first clock, Running and looptop
will become true, enabling both the t and output FF's to clock. Thus
we have a pipeline which samples a and b inputs pins, ANDs them togather
to produce t one clock later, and one more clock later the t value
appears on the pin output.  Looptop here is the one hot state variable
for the while loop.
<p>
The conditional statements such as if and while produce one hot
selected multiplexors. For example the if-then-else:
<pre>
	if(c)
	    t = a;
	else
	    t = b;
</pre>
ANDs c with terms in the then block, ANDs ~c with terms in the else
block, producing a multiplexor with the boolean equation of
<pre>
        t = (c*a) + (~c*b).
</pre>
More complex if statements produce multiplexors
for all variables assigned in the then and else branches.  While
loops are created similarly, where the conditional forms the one hot
state variable controlling the mux for all values assigned in the loop.
The following example shows this:
<pre>
	volatile _Bool a;
	volatile _Bool b;
	volatile _Bool c;
	volatile _Bool t;
	volatile _Bool output;

	main() {
	    while(a|b|c) {
		output = t;
		if(c)
		    t = a;
		else
		    t = b;
	    }
	}
</pre>
produces the following cnf net list with the same 5 LUT/FFs as before:
<pre>
	$ fpgac -target cnf ifelse.c; cat ifelse.cnf
	ifelse/Running^CLK = VCC;
	a^CLK = port(a);
	b^CLK = port(b);
	c^CLK = port(c);
	t^(CLK*ifelse/main/S0/T2/looptop) = (b*~c)+(b*a)+(c*a);
	port(output,"a12")^(CLK*ifelse/main/S0/T2/looptop) = t;
	ifelse/main/S0/T2/looptop^CLK = (ifelse/main/S0/T21/twoop)+(ifelse/main/S0/T20/twoop);
	ifelse/main/S0/T20/twoop = (~ifelse/Running*c)+(~/ifelse/Running*b)+(~ifelse/Running*a);
	ifelse/main/S0/T21/twoop = (ifelse/main/S0/T2/looptop*c)+(ifelse/main/S0/T2/looptop*b)+(ifelse/main/S0/T2/looptop*a);
</pre>
plus added an additional IBUF for port c, and two additional LUTs
for the conditional expression controlling the one hot state
looptop. If the conditional (a | b | c) ever is false then both
twoop terms will become zero, and looptop will become zero after
the next clock. Looptop being zero, will disable the clocks for
both the t and output FFs, and the circuit will halt. Note that
looptop and Running will remain clocked. The T20_twoop is only
active for the first clock, as Running is never cleared. Once the
T21_twoop condition is cleared, it can never be set again, thus we
have a stable halt condition.
<p>
The naming of the twoop temporary variables
is because these expressions where built from functions which take two
inputs and produce a temporary result, hence the name Two Op for the temporary result.
<p>
The right hand side for the t FF input is the boolean reduction for
both the while and if conditionals. Since looptop guards the clock, it was
unnecessary to include the while conditional here.
<p>
Logical operations on variables wider than one bit are implemented the
same way, just repeating the operations bit for bit. Arithmetic
operations are constructed bit for bit using the boolean functions
which implement them.
<p>
Both of these examples have a single state that can be active (the
while loop body). If we add assignments above and below the
while loop, then there will be three one hot states (code above the
while executed once on power up, the while loop body, and code below
the while executed once when the while loop exits).
<p>
The FpgaC parser is built on lex and yacc (or the GNU flex/bison) tools
so the grammar can be easily extended, as many Computer Science
students
and other professionals are familiar with these compiler generation
tools.
<h3>Circuit Size and Speed</h3>
The compiler will generate carry select adders and subtracters by
default. These adders are usually almost twice the speed of a
simple ripple carry adder, but are roughly 50% larger in area. If you
are more concerned about size than speed, use the -fno-carry-select
flag to force the compiler to use ripple carry adders instead.
Currently FpgaC only uses LUT based netlists, and doesn't directly
target additional vendor specific features like multiplexors and carry
logic that may exist along with the LUT, although some vendors tools
may perform this optimization transparently.
<p>
The -dverbose flag will print an estimate of the circuit's size and
speed on the standard error output. It will include the number of
lookup tables and flipflop needed, and the number of lookup tables
encountered in the longest combinational path. The estimate may be
incorrect, as vendor place and route tools may find a different way of
implementing or optimizing the circuit.
<h3>Generating Good Circuits</h3>
Using &lt; or &gt;= signed comparisons will produce smaller, faster circuits
than using &lt;= or &gt;, since the circuit just has to check the sign
bit of a subtracter in the first two cases.
<p>
Using the same variable for different things in your circuit may
produce a larger and slower circuit. Each assignment to a variable adds
another input to a multiplexer, and large multiplexers may become the
critical path in your circuit. Use different variables for different
things, and don't try to save space by reusing a variable.
<p>
Using "else if" clauses WILL burden all the statements in the
else clause with the negated conditional. Sometimes this is the
correct, and expected result, other times it is simply not
necessary. While this avoids executing unnecessary instructions
on a traditional processor, it WILL create additional overhead for
FpgaC code. Use
<pre>
    if(state == a) ...
    else if(state == b) ...
</pre>
when you mean
<pre>
    if(state == a) ...
    if(!(state == a) &amp;&amp; state == b) ...
</pre>
otherwise use
<pre>
    if(state == a) ...
    if(state == b) ...
</pre>
if states a and b are mutually exclusive. Otherwise multiplexors will
be formed for all statements in the b clause which include the !(state
== a) term. Note the sevenseg function in the example below. Because
statements in FpgaC execute in parallel when possible, this allows
all 16 of the if statements in sevenseg to be executed in parallel,
with only one assignment enabled. If the 16 if statements had been
chained with else clauses, they would form a long sequential combinatorial.
<p>
When your function does have long combinatorials, it will require a
slower clock. Look for ways to avoid unnecessary conditional terms, and
ways to use pipelining for statement blocks.
<h3>Common Design Errors</h3>
There are several things that can cause a FpgaC generated circuit to
fail mysteriously. First, be sure to use xdelay to check that the
circuit will run at the desired clock frequency.
<p>
All FpgaC integer variables are signed integers, and they will be
sign-extended when used in expressions. For example:
<pre>
    char a, b;
    // 8 bit signed integer
    int result; //16 bit signed integer

    result = (a&lt;&lt;8) | b;
</pre>
does not work when b is 0xF0,
because it will be sign extended to
0xFFF0 before being or-ed with a.
Instead, use:
<pre>
   char a, b;
   int result;

   result = (a&lt;&lt;8) | (b&amp;0xFF);
</pre>
which works because literal constants are sign extended only when they
are clearly negative. However, the last fix fails when the
variables are more than 31 bits wide, because the compiler can only
handle constants up to 32 bits wide. In particular, 0xFFFFFFFF is
identical to -1, and will be sign extended. To build a larger mask,
use a constant expression like ((1&lt;&lt;NBITS) - 1).

<h3>Known "Features"</h3>
Although there is no limit on the size of a variable, integer constants
are limited to 32 bits.
<p>
If the program exits from main(), the circuit will no longer have any
active states. FFs and arrays which are not clock enabled will continue
to clock with their outputs feed back into their inputs, which will
consume some dynamic power. Otherwise the circuit will appear halted as
it will not respond to inputs and outputs will not change unless a
combinatorial relationship has been constructed between inputs and outputs
(which is unlikely).
<p>
If a function changes a global variable, the rest of the circuit won't see
the change until the next clock tick. There isn't an automatic clock tick
when a function returns. If the function changes a global variable and
immediately returns, you can't use the value of that global variable until
after the next clock tick.
<p>
There isn't strong typing for any variable, including those declared
with VOID. VOID is included only for portability and to visually comment
functions without returns. All FpgaC variables are inherently static, and
will retain their previous value between uses.
<p>
Unsigned variables are currently signed, and included as an alias for
signed integers to ease portability of existing C code for the time being.
Signed variables are actually one bit wider than you might expect because of
the added sign bit. If you explicitly need unsigned overflow/underflow,
simply mask the variable with as many one bits as you need, and the
compiler will truncate the variable at compile time to be unsigned (IE
var &amp; 0xffff). Also, if the sign bit is never referenced by a path
that affects the state of an output, it will be discarded at compile
time. This will probably be fixed in either beta-3 or beta-4 in the
first half of 2006.
