This is an untested prototype design to use a batch of XC4062XL "new" pulls from
surplus new boards I have had left over from an old project a few years back.
These designs are several years old, and were done as proof-of-concept projects.

No schematic was prepared for this layout, it was just done cold connecting pins
that were the easiest for the layout. Use PCB-050315 with this layout, as the
current pcb version using the new GUI interface are dead slow with this many
pins and pads. If want to reverse engineer a schematic, I'd suggest asking pcb
to dump the connection list for the FPGA and work from that netlist.

I expect to fab and checkout these boards this fall which should produce a series
of FpgaC reference designs which support them. If you would like to help the
project do so, voluteers are welcome.
