This directory contains useful examples in exploring FpgaC's
capabilities and useful applications. It contains several
directories:

   tmcc  - these are the original TMCC examples updated
	   for FpgaC's syntax. These examples also served
           as a regression test for TMCC, and now FpgaC.
           We do not have one of these cards for testing.

   pipes - these are pipeline examples, including a
           simple tutorial in building power FpgaC
           pipelined applications.

   pci   - An example of a Target mode PCI bus interface written
           using FpgaC for a Dini DN2K card with Virtex 2000E
           FPGAs.  Easily portable to other cards with FPGA PCI
           interfaces.

   crypto - An example of a highly parallel AES encryption core
           in FpgaC with both sequential and pipelined with
           testbench.

   regression_tests - A small, but growing, collection of netlist
           checks for verifing correct netlist generation.
