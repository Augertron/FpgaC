This directory contains useful examples in exploring FpgaC's
capabilities and useful applications. It contains several
directories:

   tmcc  - these are the original TMCC examples updated
	   for FpgaC's syntax. These examples also served
           as a regression test for TMCC, and now FpgaC.

   pipes - these are pipeline examples, including a
           simple tutorial in building power FpgaC
           pipelined applications.
