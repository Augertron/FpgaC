This directory contains regression tests for various compiler productions.

These loop tests are expected to produce the same control functions in both
the FOR loop and WHILE loop forms:

	loops_4_for.c
	loops_4_while.c
	loops_7_for.c
	loops_7_while.c
	loops_8_for.c
	loops_8_while.c
	loops_9_for.c
	loops_9_while.c

there will be temp variable names which are different.

Other tests are expected to produce output identical to their reference cnf files.

There are a few files which are currently broken ... see comments in individual .c
files.
