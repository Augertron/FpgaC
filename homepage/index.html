First, special thanks to Dave Galloway's original <a
 href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/EECG/RESEARCH/tmcc/tmcc/">TMCC</a>
hardware description
language work for the University of Toronto's <a
 href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/%7Ejayar/research/tm2.html">Transmogrifier</a>
system which was the starting point for this project.<br>
<br>
The beta-2 release includes project
work since the initial beta release
by Isaac Pentinmaki,&nbsp; Rahul Menon, and John Bass.&nbsp; See the
top level README file for contributions, and the user manual in the doc
directory for more information.<br>
<br>
FpgaC is an amazingly powerful tool, even in it's current subset C
form, for exploring reconfigurable computing projects.&nbsp; This is
very useful for many C programmers wishing to develop robotics or other
hobby applications. Code testing can largely be done with a
traditional compiler and source code debug environment, and once
working, moved to the FPGA target platform with FpgaC.&nbsp; Much
easier than learning VHDL or Verilog, and debugging in a simulator
environment with test vectors for applications which involve complex
algorithms and state machines.<br>
<br>
Other team members are welcome that would like to join the FpgaC
project.&nbsp;
Several job postings have been made for short term projects, and longer
term help is certainly welcome.&nbsp; See the Feature Requests page for
project ideas, and be sure to add your own too.<br>
<br>
If you enjoyed your compilers class, want to contribute to open source
Reconfigurable Computing, or are looking for a senior
project or thesis, consider helping with FpgaC for your project.<br>
<br>
If you find this tool useful, and would like to help further it's
development with donations, feel free to
